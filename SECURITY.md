## üîê Security Considerations

This AI-powered changelog generator handles git repository analysis and LLM API integrations. Key security areas include:

### LLM Provider Security

- API keys are stored securely using the built-in configuration store
- All communications with LLM providers use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- API rate limits and request validation prevent abuse
- Proper error handling prevents API key disclosure in logs or outputs

### Git Repository Security

- Local git repository access is read-only for commit analysis
- No modification of git history or repository state
- Repository path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- Commit message parsing includes input sanitization

### Configuration Security

- Secure config store using the `conf` package for API key storage
- No hardcoded API keys or secrets in source code
- Configuration file permissions are validated where possible
- Secure defaults for all configuration options

### CLI Security

- Input validation for all command-line arguments
- File path validation prevents unauthorized file system access
- Output sanitization prevents injection attacks
- Proper error handling avoids information disclosure

## üè≠ Production Security Checklist

Before using magic-release in production environments:

**Configuration Security:**

- [ ] Use the built-in secure config store for API keys (`magicr --set-api-key`)
- [ ] Set restrictive file permissions on any custom configuration files
- [ ] Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring for automated workflows
- [ ] Validate all input parameters and file paths
- [ ] Keep the tool updated to the latest version

**Environment Security:**

- [ ] Use secure, up-to-date Node.js runtime (20+)
- [ ] Deploy in isolated environments with minimal privileges
- [ ] Implement proper network security controls for CI/CD environments
- [ ] Regular backup of generated changelog outputs
- [ ] Monitor for unusual API usage patterns

**Operational Security:**

- [ ] Regular rotation of API keys and access tokens
- [ ] Audit logs for unauthorized access attempts in automated systems
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API calls in CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Regular review of generated changelog content for sensitive data

## üîç Security Features

This project implements several security measures:

### Built-in Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs and file paths are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information disclosure
- **Secure Configuration**: Built-in secure storage for API keys using the `conf` package
- **Access Control**: Read-only access to git repositories and file system

### LLM Integration Security

- **Secure API Communication**: All LLM provider APIs accessed via HTTPS
- **API Key Protection**: Secure local storage with no hardcoded credentials
- **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and size limits for all API requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in respect for provider rate limits and quotas

### Code Analysis Security

- **Safe Git Operations**: Read-only git repository analysis
- **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal and unauthorized file access
- **Content Filtering**: Automatic filtering of potentially sensitive code patterns
- **Output Sanitization**: Generated changelog content is sanitized before output
